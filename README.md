A few things to take care of while using this:

- Lint
Run `yarn lint` before committing to prevent any linting related errors. We use `standard.js` for formatting.

- Commit
We follow conventional commits. Hence we request you to use `yarn commit` instead of `git commit`

- Tests
To test locally run `yarn test`

No PRs will be merged without test cases.
